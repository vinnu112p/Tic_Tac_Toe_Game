Tic Tac Toe Game
Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
